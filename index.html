    <p id="fontcolor"> the concept of dimensional reality makes use of the existence of dimensional planes in which objects
    exist. humans are capable of perceiving three dimensions, arbitrarily labeled 1, 2, 3 for example purpopses. objects cannot
    perceive other objects that exist outside of their dimensional plane but can see the portions that overlap. theoretically, say
    the earth existed in planes: 1-6, then another species of three dimensional form could exist as well in the plans, 4-6. </p>
    <p id="fontcolor">alien existence may be no further than our own planet, but unfathomably powerful technology would be necessary to prove
    this claim, or to come to any point of recognizing it as viable. </p>

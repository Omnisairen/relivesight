    <p>> [no. 03] : "If something decides it wants to fly, will it grow wings? You don't change yourself, you change the way you do things. You have to create a way to fly, even while you stay the same."</p>
    <p>> [no. 00095] : "People only have substance within the memories of other people."</p>
    <p>> [no. 03] : "Man fears the darkness, and so he scrapes away at the edges of it with fire."</p>
    <p>> [no. 00095] : "The universe has a beginning, but no end. — Infinity. Stars, too, have their own beginnings, but their own power results in their destruction. — Finite."</p>
    <p>> [no. 03] : "People save themselves on their own. Nobody can ever save someone else."</p>
    <p>> [no. 00095] : "The tendrils of my hair illuminate beneath the amber glow.
Bathing.
It must be this one.
The last remaining streetlight to have withstood the test of time.
The last yet to be replaced by the sickening blue-green of the future.
I bathe. Calm; breathing air of the present but living in the past.
The light flickers.
I flicker back."</p>
    <p>> [no. 03] : "Everything that lives is designed to end. We are perpetually trapped in a never-ending spiral of life and death. Is this a curse? Or some kind of punishment? I often think about the god who blessed us with this cryptic puzzle...and wonder if we'll ever get the chance to kill him."</p>
    <p>> [no. 00095] : "If i didnt make that promise for her, you'd be dead where you stand."</p>
    <p>> [no. 03] : "If we all reacted the same way, we'd be predictable, and there's always more than one way to view a situation...It's simple: overspecialize, and you breed in weakness. It's slow death."</p>
    <p>> [no. 00095] : "Mathematics catalogues everything that is not self-contradictory; within that vast inventory, physics is an island of structures rich enough to contain their own beholders."</p>
    <p>> [no. 03] : "It’s better to have questions you can’t answer than answers you can’t question."</p>
    <p>> [no. 00095] : "The unexamined life is not worth living."</p>
    <p>> [no. 03] : "You couldn't be more wrong actually, I'm unbelievably sentimental. You know, the best thing would be to actually be as earnest as I feel. Because I know what I'm doing, just everything that I do, it knows what it is."</p>
    <p>> [no. 00095] : "As long as you make the important decisions yourself, that’s what matters, you are the protagonist of your own life."</p>

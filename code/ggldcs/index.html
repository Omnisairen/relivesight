      <h1>G.G.L.D.C.S.</h1>
      <p> it stands for Goo G Le Docs Cuzthat Swhereidecidetohostmyimagesfromnowon</p>
      <p>okay okay so i talked briefly about my image hosting strategy in yesterdays daily log, but it was long and laborious
        so i needed to find a way to automate it. the solution? thisssss, so it took a few trys of different things and by no means is this a great solution,
        but ehhhhh it works for me sorry im no pro
      </p>
      <p>So the steps for what I did:
        <br>- Open the google drive and select the folder</a>
        <br>- Run this python program:
      </p>
        <pre><code class='python'>import pyautogui, sys, time
from pynput.mouse import Button, Controller


mouse = Controller()

pyautogui.moveTo(1800, 370)
mouse.press(Button.left)
pyautogui.moveTo(428, 680, 2)



for x in range(1,5):
mouse.scroll(0, -50)
pyautogui.moveTo(440, 680, 1)
time.sleep(2)
pyautogui.moveTo(428, 680, 1)


mouse.release(Button.left)  
           </code>
           </pre>
           <p>what this program does is selects all the imgs in the folder so i can grab the links,
             but i still needed to do magic trick to get the links into useable for html, as they are both a big blob of text
            and full of wrong info, here's the code to sort it out</p>
            <pre><code class='python'>stroodle = input('paste here: ')

stroodletoodle = stroodle.replace('/view?usp=sharing,%20https://drive.google.com/file/d/',
'"style="width: 664px;"/>\n《img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=')
print('《img src=https:/drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id='
+stroodletoodle +'"style="width: 664px;"/》') 
                                   </code>
                                   </pre>
                                   <p>and then the outputted stuff from that goes right into code! works for me. thats this simple inneficient program that helps me upload images for my website.</p>

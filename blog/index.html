      <h2>Logs ┈ N≡Days</h2>
      <p>—「0X://Explanation」<br>
        the logs of my semi-day-to-week life. a newly updated aesthetic #702720... this will hopefully keep me accountable and you partially entertained.
        here i log the happenings of my life (more related to projects and such, not whether or not i had strawberries today), thanks!~  
      </p>

        a near month passing? nahh. to be fair i did say i had to do midterms and my last one is today. i'll get
        back on things over spring break, so that'll be good. i got sick for two weeks so can you really blame me? 
        </p>
              <p>—「02://External」<br> 
              maybe you can, to which i say, well at least i managed to make a few edits, i've really been doing that 
              more than my other hobbies rn, trying to get to a style that i am happy with. in reverse chronological from future to past 
              order we have: 
                 
              </p>

              </ul>
              <p>
                so yeah hopefully these edits are more impressive and hopefully i continue to get better, expect a project to start soon and new edits 
                as well. thanks for reading!~

        okay so i know its been 11 days and i know i make more excuses than not excuses lately but once i get some midterms done
        i will ***really*** be back on it.

                i haven't been completely dead tho. i made 2 edits, 1 of which is "good", the other is kinda cringe. i tried to focus 
                more on typography/mograph type stuff, with the addition of improved transitions, but in reality everything came out looking 
                lax on both sides. so more learning and more practice is the solution

                now here is the cool part of this news, rather than just me being like oh yeah i made new stuff or whatever. so 
                since i switched the posting square videos (cuz they look better on insta), youtube now recognizes them as "shorts" or whatever.
                which maybe that doesn't sound like a particularly exciting development, but dw i was just building to it. my average upload get like
                20-60 views, my two "shorts" have gotten 627 and 355 (at the time of writing) respectively!! im only posting shorts now~~

        does rewatching a bunch of assassination classroom count as being productive? probably not huh. um i'll get on editing soon but i did

                then i'll be able to get my head straight and figure out what projects i want to do next. even tho im saying this mostly to myself,

        it should be illegal how fast time passes. i've been a bit busy with schoolwork, but i'll really try to get some real things done.

              <p>—「02://Website」<br>
                in the meantime: i updated the home page with two ~BRAND NEW~ fancy pages. i thought these new "artsy-ish"
                pages i am working on should go somewhere more special than a subcategory on the homepage (also clutter) so 
                they have their own weird pod things. i would describe them better, but i can't imagine you navigated here without passing
                them (unless ur from the future where i replaced them, then this is kinda awkward huh).
              </p>   
              <p>i put a good amount of work into <a href="https://relivesight.com/athame" target="_blank">project athame</a>, so i'd appreciate you checking it out.
                i also updated the favicon on every page (with exception) to the "new" re:live (society) logo, 
                i didn't realize i hadn't done that yet. but yeah here's all page updates this time around
                listed:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><a href="https://relivesight.com/" target="_blank">homepage</a> - those side thingys</li>
                <li><a href="https://relivesight.com/athame" target="_blank">PROJECT ATHAME</a> - details: CLASSIFIED - [the "coolest" page yet]</li>
                <li><a href="https://relivesight.com/edits" target="_blank">edits</a> - woah all the edits ive made how fancy</li>
                <li><a href="https://relivesight.com/artlogs" target="_blank">artlogs</a> - moved things around, added athame</li>
                <li><a href="https://relivesight.com/video" target="_blank">video</a> - added edits page</li>
              </ul>
              <p>a few pages got evicerated, only real ones remember what they were. but i mean im glad to clean them up.
                plan on actually doing some studylogs so that tab will finally have purpose. gimme some time tho

              so so so i also spent like 2 days putting songs into 15 fitting playlists. they aren't perfect and some 
              are more guilty pleasure and personal preference more than following the vibe, but at least there is a decent selection. (about 60hrs of music iirc)
              all of them can be found at the partially updated: <a href="https://relivesight.com/lists/music/" target="_blank">music page</a>,
              <br>but some personal reccomendations are: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/r71hs9yfjn5lsahhdpeiysalc/playlist/0qbrtFz6867xUUcj4DkLnJ?si=qvBrrjeGRxe8teDQ9AJygQ" target="_blank">𝕛-𝕡 =【𝓋𝒾𝓇𝒶𝓁 𝒾𝓃𝒻𝒶𝓉𝓊𝒶𝓉𝒾𝑜𝓃】</a>,

              they are all best listened to on shuffle, but i understand if that ain't your thing.
              </p>   
              <p>in other (non) news, no projects have progressed over this break. (other than giving the
                <a href="https://relivesight.com/projects/2bboard/" target="_blank">2b board</a> an official resting place). work 
                will proceed asap, i just really dislike the project im working on tbh. but like the man in the pot said:
                "get over it"
              </p>
              <p>actually i lied, i also figured out a new way to do images so thats cool, hopefully that means even faster loading times. i also
                am slowly cleaning up the code, and i decreased the size of alot of the pictures on the site. i think it went from like 500mb or smth to 187mb, 
                which is pretty good so far.

                start to finish on my own. it was utterly shocking that the model (mostly) fit perfectly, it was good positive reinforcement to

        happy holidays~ its christmas eve, but more importantly i made quite a bit of progress on quite a few projects.
        turns out learning to model (at least basic geometric things) was not as scary as i thought. i almost enjoy it more than editing right now, 
        maybe because it's a relatively simple task and takes less cognitive processing, either way it shouldn't be too much longer till i have the skills
        to try a project like a cyberdeck, but for now we should make sure those models i made actually fit 
        </p>
        <p>the art page was also removed from the homepage (now under /concept), but is still accessible from the sidebar, i'm just not that proud of what is in it and how it looks.
          i honestly want to take it off of the sidebar, but art logs would be too empty without it for now, so it gets to stay ￣-￣

      I also added my twitch to my <a href="https://relivesight.com/bio/" target="_blank">bio</a>.
      I will return to working on the website, predominantly the parts that don't involve me, since i want to expand this from a personal blog to a more functional site for others.
      Though i can't gurauntee the rate at which progress proceeds, considering i start college relatively soon. However, i will try my best!~

      First of all, i didn't really mention it in the last log but when i did that "overhaul" of the site css and aesthetic, i literally changed
      about 70 pages, which even tho the changes were quite minor it was alot of work lol. i would continue here to talk about the page techincally "added"
      yesterday, but that is also technically a hardware thing so look forward to it in the next section.

      it was quite a journey, please check out the semi-lengthy writeup, i tried a new writeup style too. box miku was finished as well, i guess all my projects are miku related rn huh.

      <p>—「01://Website」<br>
      Honestly for quite a long time i was dissatisfied with how the website looked. I spent some time experimenting with different looks and layouts.
      Also while i was dissapointed with how it looked creatively, it also suffered logistically. Some website pointed me towards <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dotcom-tools.com/website-speed-test.aspx">this website speed test</a>
      and it became clear my site was far from optimized. </p><p>I actually like the look of the home page, so i saw no reason to change that, but my feelings towards other pages (especially the farthest nested ones, e.g. the reference tutorials, project logs, and code pages)
      remained far from satisfactory. So after some experimentation, i settled on a new look i liked, but most importantantly it was:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>significantly faster</li>
        <li>smaller in size</li>
        <li>pleasant on the eyes</li>
        <li>somewhatcreative(???)</li>
        <li>not made in the uk凶</li>
      </ul><p>
   
      this is most fervently shown off in its use here -- !the!~!daily!~!logs! but i will also list all pages that received the new makeover ✿ 
      <br>
      all pages that received (at least) some alteration were:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="#">~this page~</a></li>
        <li><a target="_blank" href="https://relivesight.com/reference/">reference</a></li>
        <li>^ all of its subpages</li>
        <li><a target="_blank" href="https://relivesight.com/projects/">projects</a></li>
        <li>^ all of its subpages</li>
        <li><a target="_blank" href="https://relivesight.com/randomlove/">random love</a></li>
        <li>^ all of its subpages</li>
        <li><a target="_blank" href="https://relivesight.com/studylogs/">study logs</a></li>
        <li>^ technically its subpages but none are done yet oops</li>
        <li><a target="_blank" href="https://relivesight.com/anime/">anime</a></li>
        <li>^ its (1) one subpage</li>
        <li><a target="_blank" href="https://relivesight.com/code/">code</a></li>
        <li>^ all of its subpages (wow technically 1 again)</li>
        <li><a target="_blank" href="https://relivesight.com/sites/">sites</a> (finally one without subpages)</li>
        <li><a target="_blank" href="https://relivesight.com/code/">manga</a></li>
        <li>^ all of its subpages < it actually has two levels of em</li>
        <li><a target="_blank" href="https://relivesight.com/art/">art</a></li>
        <li>^ all of its subpages</li>
        <li><a target="_blank" href="https://relivesight.com/video/">video</a></li>
        <li>^ its (2) two subpages</li>
        <li><a target="_blank" href="https://relivesight.com/spam/">spam</a></li>
        <li>^ all of its subpages</li>
        <li><a target="_blank" href="https://relivesight.com/spam/">concept</a></li>
        <li>^ all of its subpages - tho its subpages are just other pages that have been relocated</li>
      </ul><p>
   
      thats pretty much all thats done on the list so far (i personally recommend checking out the reference guide for the wii.), i like the bio, though i understand it doesn't really fit the aesthetic, i just can help but love that crt display effect. either way
      the next scheduled change is replacing the guestbook with a contact me page -- ill have to do some research about that. Speaking of research, no i don't intend on letting study logs sit dead forever, i just needed some time to organize the site better (i.e. now) so ill get on that relatively soon,
      however project logs will always come first ::hence the next section.
      <br>
      </p>
  
  <p>—「02://Hardware」<br>
      a few projects are underway, namely being: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>rc128bm - failed but not logged</li>
        <li>box miku - who is she and what does she want?</li>
        <li>karambit - cs:go who</li>
        <li>split keyboard(x2)</li>
      </ul><p>
   
      expect updates on each of them relatively soon. the rc128bm is truly a story of epic proportions that show just how naive one can truly be.
      either way lesson learned, next project! 
      <br>

   i've poured a significant amount of time into reading about enhnaced security measures for your average tech savvy individual. i plan on doing a comprehensive write-up to help my fellow denizens of the internet.
   it turns out i've been quite ignorant for a large part of my life, so here's to the future of more informed research. /istilldontgethowgitworks/</p><p> oh yeah also obviously ive been reading about split keyboards cuz turns out that decided to be
   6 more times complicated than i thought. maybe i've been looking in the wrong places and just somehow missed something obvious??? but i should probably get a linux distro going and figure that out. good luck me! ty you!~

    More is done. im trying to get more and more of the backlogs done as i go (shown in the image section below :: known as 「0X://Breathing」for you uninitiated)
  
      Which ill address that yes i know the guest book is kinda broken and it will only show 10 comments, yes ill fix it eventually, but for now im trying to make this site a more interesting place to stumble across, with lots of resources and produced things
      other than just< a bio about myself. the first of many steps in that direction is the <a target="_blank" href="https://relivesight.com/sites/">sites page</a>. and quite contridictory to this anti-narcisistic change is the
      <a target="_blank" href="https://relivesight.com/about/">about page</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://relivesight.com/art/irl/">irl pics sub-art page</a> which feature pics of me that im semi proud of. im trying to find a
      style, and ill take some time to learn in photoshop when i can~

    Finished legend of korra - not even sure if i can offer an unbiased stand point on it. 《in english so i can code/etc while watching it? 
   good corieography? good worldbuilding / character devlopment? talented voice actors?》 yup you win! i literally cant do anything other than appreciate this. nonetheless i truly think it is worth critical 'acclaim'
   and i will personally discuss and disprove any issues you have with it​♡

  I can pretend i was enlightened earlier / but alas i would be deceiving, i have finally mastered irc and tis a great method of communication. special private discussion can happen there,,,
  i recently discovered
  a particular magazine which has inspired me to potentially develop something like this of my own. hopefully im not too out of place here.
  it will truly take some intense photoshop practice first, as their covers especially are a sight to behold. four is a/a/a/a//a/a/a/ personal favorite of mine.

    indeed, i very clearly updated this page┈♡~ hopefully the changes are viewed as upgrades, cuz thats how
    i see them,! the code was a bit intricate to make this work┈ its also like my second time using animations. also the full outline wasnt working initially, cuz i forgot the page id had overlap:hidden; how cringe of me ✿ but in the end it all worked out!!!~ and im not applying the new effects to the old logs to show the distinctions but then and ███████.

  the legend of korra really knows how to hold one's attention,,,,its utilizing the
  intruige of its natural world building to force me to excuse a flashback sequence, truly the cruelest move they could perform against someone trying to think critically about the show. it frequently jogs my memory about the parts i loved about the last airbender, and does a fantastic job of cleaning up its flaws, tho its definitely far from free of them itself. also i dont mean to fangirl but varrick being a villain is so gooooood but also aaaaaAAAAaaa sdlksdjsjdjjjddddd i LOVE HIm his character is SO sporatic teach me to be that eccentric~

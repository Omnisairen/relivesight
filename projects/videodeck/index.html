            <p>—「0X://Explanation」<br>
             a deck to edit video more effeciently by utilizing shortcuts, hotkeys, and encoder knobs! runs on a teensy lc
             and hopefully looks cool as well

              <h1>Log 1: Preparations</h1>
             <p>this is will utilize Zach Freedman's <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ZackFreedman/Big-Wheel">Big Wheel Project</a>,
            thanks for open source info, but maybe i'll redesign it to suit my needs. for now:
             </p>
             <p>the things i need to get/design/program are:</p>
             <ul>
               <li><strike>teensy lc</strike></li>
               <li><strike>keyboard switches</strike></li>
               <li><strike>encoders</strike></li>
               <li><strike>wires</strike></li>
               <li>3d printed case</li>
               <li>3d printed encoder knobs</li>
               <li>firmware</li>
             </ul>
             <p>after looking through the files, alot of it actually looks like it fits really well, so i'm going to test print it later, but
               i double checked key size to be sure:
             </p>

             <p>here is the whole model, looks good for now:</p>

             <h1>Log 2: Hardware</h1>
             <p>okay so i printed all of the models from the Big Wheel project, and each of them didn't work for me in a different way.
               they added an extra screw hole on the case, which seems helpful for support, but literally blocks you from putting in the teensy.
               maybe i made some other mistake with what parts i picked but the waffle plate just came in contact with the switches and encoders i had put in.
               and finally the big wheel didnt fit on the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08728K3YB/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1">encoders</a> i bought, but that is entirely my fault for not measuring. so i "fixed" all the
               models to fit my needs (also making the case taller to make wiring easy, but i ended up having plenty of space anyway) and the new
               models can be downloaded <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4702814">here</a>.
             </p>
             <p>using the new now working model, i put in the switches and encoders (and apparently took super overexposed pictures?):</p>
             <img src="https://vibrant-hodgkin-c6365a.netlify.app/project/videodeck/1.jpg" width="500px">
             <p>wired all of the diodes (besides the one for the encoder that blocks the teensy port):</p>
             <img src="https://vibrant-hodgkin-c6365a.netlify.app/project/videodeck/2.jpg" width="500px">
             <p>wired all of rows (again except for the one encoder):</p>
             <img src="https://vibrant-hodgkin-c6365a.netlify.app/project/videodeck/3.jpg" width="500px">
             <p>then i soldered color coded wires to the teensy:</p>
             <img src="https://vibrant-hodgkin-c6365a.netlify.app/project/videodeck/4.jpg" width="500px">
             <p>and wired it all together!</p>
             <img src="https://vibrant-hodgkin-c6365a.netlify.app/project/videodeck/5.jpg" width="500px">
             <p>simple as that</p>
             <h1>Log 3: Software</h1>
             <p>reworking the software took longer than it should've, because the original creator had wired their diodes
               backwards, and i wasn't sure what to change to fix it (it was just flipping the pins) so those adjustments
              have been made in my version. you can download the original files in the original project or mine here:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><a target="_blank" href="https://pastebin.com/TQvFzrdr">Big_Wheel_Macro_pad_Firmware_Edit</a></li>

              </ul>
              <p>here are what my keybindings do:</p>

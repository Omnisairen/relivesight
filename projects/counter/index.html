            <h2>Pageview Counter</h2>
            <p>—「0X://Explanation」<br>
              i saw someone with a youtube subscriber counter display and decided i wanted one as well, but i don't have many subs, so instead i will do something i have alot of:
              pageviews! <strike>we are coming up on 50k so its a perfect time to build the counter <3</strike> we passed 50k before i could finish, thanks <3 but also cmon >:c
                (at the final moment working on the project it was: 51823)

              <h1>Log 1: Purcha$e$</h1>
             <p>suprisingly i dont have any led matrix displays and node mcu v3's on hand (though i do have the ESP XXXX units, i just dont know how to use them), so i
               had to order parts. in addition to that i've begun 3d printing the case: </p>
                <img src="https://vibrant-hodgkin-c6365a.netlify.app/project/counter/1.jpeg" width="500px">
                <p>the middle piece of the case has detached thrice while printing, which never happens. this has caused (un)believable frustration as this has never happened.
                  theories: (1) the glue sticks are too dry cuz i s*ck at closing them. (2) i thought it was supports but i already ruled that out so it better be #1. 
                  i'll work on the electronics and programming in the meantime.

<p>this code just prints it to the console,, now to get it running on the node mcu v3,,, and over wifi,,,, and displayed on the led matrix,,,,,</p>



<h1>Log 2: The Agony</h1>
<p>everything is here!, but alas it cannot be that simple. programming the software doesn't seem that hard right? well we'll see...
  i won't bore you with the details, but i wasted time searching for what i need and setlled on micropython for the nodemcuv3, my naive self pressed forward assuming
  i could get this setup in an afternoon.
</p>
   <p>ok so i went on over to the <a type="_blank" href="https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/esp8266/tutorial/intro.html">micropython docs</a> and began following the tutorial.
    sure a bit foreign, but nothing too out of my comfot zone right? (see next)
   </p>
     <img src="https://vibrant-hodgkin-c6365a.netlify.app/project/counter/1.png" width="500px">                
<p>well that can't be good. (awhile later): well turns out the repl just displays jargin if the baud rate is wrong (and sometimes even when its right), but nothing a few
  resets couldn't fix. lets just configure webrepl now! (see next)
</p>
<img src="https://vibrant-hodgkin-c6365a.netlify.app/project/counter/2.png" width="500px">  
<p>ah, joyous.</p>
<p>reflashed the board with a more modern .bin file, still nothing. to reddit we go! <a type="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/esp8266/comments/jidk6y/help_with_webrepl_in_micropython/">my question</a>
was answered by the lovely <a type="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ImpressiveVersion9/">u/ImpressiveVersion9</a>, and to my suprise, their solution worked (even tho i couldve sworn i had already tried it).
nonetheless if finally connected:</p>
<img src="https://vibrant-hodgkin-c6365a.netlify.app/project/counter/5.png" width="300px">  
<p>as delightful as this may seem, the next occurence soured the mood quite a bit. my python script can't run on the nodemcu v3. not entirely sure why, but
  i'll come up with something else. and i did! (kinda). i wrote a flask python server that outputs the view count as html (because i was able to write an html grabber in micropython). i could then
  host this on some random pc/microcomputer in my room somewhere, but theres one caveat. i cant get the localhost to be available over lan (despite my incessant (and correct) use if my device ip). 
  so that is where i'm currently stuck, ill keep trying other methods till i get this server hosted.
</p>
<p>p.s. i also discovered the <a type="_blank" href="https://github.com/mcauser/micropython-max7219">max7219 library</a> by mcauser which allowed me to program
the displays (enough to show 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, but not much else yet. wish me luck (bonus: they are extremely bright):</p>

<h1>Log 3: Part Four</h1>
<p> i think i forgot to mention what i printed for the case: but the files i used are
  <a type="_blank" href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2811071">this</a> and 
  <a type="_blank" href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4209940">this</a>.
  other than that i did all* the rest of the programming, which was quite a hassle.
</p>
   <p>basically i had to make a local webserver that runs the python script cuz it didnt run properly on the esp8266, so i did that.
     then using <a type="_blank" href="https://github.com/micropython/micropython-lib/blob/master/urequests/urequests.py">urequests</a>
     i was able to fetch the html on the local web server and pull the data i need from it it!

<p>now just solder it up and make sure it works: </p>

<p>sweet it works! ill keep it on my windowsil:</p> 
<img src="https://vibrant-hodgkin-c6365a.netlify.app/project/counter/4.jpeg" width="400px">

<p>and its all done! it updates every minute, and honestly it seems like it wasnt much of a hassle, but 
  thats just the result of my brain removing the trauma of me troubleshooting this thing. definitely recommend this to
  learn about new things, i learned alot!

            <h2>3d modelling</h2>
            <p>—「0X://Explanation」<br>
              my quest to 3d model every object in existence, or more realistically: to get skills to model the pieces i need for all my other projects.
              this skill is essentially necessary so here is the process of me slowly learning it.

              <h1>Log 1: Learning to Model: Or not.</h1>
             <p>i have a bit (the tiniest bit) of experience in autodesk fusion 360, and this is my attempt without following any tutorials to design what i need.
                okay i just gave it a whirl, first attempt is this yes, made two sketches and shoved them together:</p>

                <p>time for printing, lets see how it turns out! (fast forward an hour) and i couldnt get the tolerances right after a few tries, so im calling it quits for today, got other stuff to do. hopefully i
                  watch tutorials lol~
                </p>


                <h1>Log 2: Keyboard Case Repair</h1>
                <p>i need to re-model a keyboard case, so a perfect opportunity to learn more about modelling. its probably a bad idea but im hoping i can just import it into
                  fusion and just wing it and edit it, we'll see how that goes...
                </p>
                <p>flash forward awhile and i learned how to import stls as meshes and convert them into BRep objects (by disabling the timeline), this allows me to edit them as i so desire
                </p>

                <p>hopefully my modificaitons turn out alright , i sent that out to the printer, now to figure out how to make the clips...</p>

                <h1>Log 3: Keyboard Case Clips</h1>
                <p>im a complete noob but i think the best thing to do first would be to take measurements and sketch it out. to be continued...</p>

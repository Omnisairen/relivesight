            <h2>3d modelling</h2>
            <p>—「0X://Explanation」<br>
              my quest to 3d model every object in existence, or more realistically: to get skills to model the pieces i need for all my other projects.
              this skill is essentially necessary so here is the process of me slowly learning it.

              <h1>Log 1: Learning to Model: Or not.</h1>
             <p>i have a bit (the tiniest bit) of experience in autodesk fusion 360, and this is my attempt without following any tutorials to design what i need.
                okay i just gave it a whirl, first attempt is this yes, made two sketches and shoved them together:</p>
                <img src="https://vibrant-hodgkin-c6365a.netlify.app/project/3dmodl/ya.png" width="500px">
                <p>time for printing, lets see how it turns out! (fast forward an hour) and i couldnt get the tolerances right after a few tries, so im calling it quits for today, got other stuff to do. hopefully i
                  watch tutorials lol~
                </p>


                <h1>Log 2: Keyboard Case Repair</h1>
                <p>i need to re-model a keyboard case, so a perfect opportunity to learn more about modelling. its probably a bad idea but im hoping i can just import it into
                  fusion and just wing it and edit it, we'll see how that goes...
                </p>
                <p>flash forward awhile and i learned how to import stls as meshes and convert them into BRep objects (by disabling the timeline), this allows me to edit them as i so desire
                </p>

                <p>hopefully my modificaitons turn out alright , i sent that out to the printer, now to figure out how to make the clips...</p>

                <h1>Log 3: Keyboard Case Clips</h1>
                <p>im a complete noob but i think the best thing to do first would be to take measurements and sketch it out. 
                  so i started by trying to make the part that will clip directly to the keyboard, im just winging it and not watching tutorials.
                this is the left side, and my theory is that the clip will be too loose and slide a little:</p>
                  <img src="https://vibrant-hodgkin-c6365a.netlify.app/project/3dmodl/2.png" width="500px">
                <p>well my theory was kinda wrong as its too tight where i intended it to go but too loose anywhere else,
                  im adding some holes to try to hold it steady and thicken the walls so it doesnt break, but i can almost gurauntee that
                  it won't fit the holes, i had trouble measuring and kinda just guessed:
                </p>

                <p>my measurements were off, but before redoing this and the clips for the side of the laptop, a quick side tangent:

                <h1>Log 4: Agaping Repair</h1>
                <p>i've always wanted a dactyl manuform that was connected as one, but i can't model a keyboard like that! so instead
                  im stitching together two halves of a dactyl with my novice modelling "skills", here is the first attempt:

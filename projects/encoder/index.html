            <h2>Encoder</h2>
            <p>—「0X://Explanation」<br>
          i had this midi device i never used, so a little bit of mx switches and microcontrollers that i know how to reprogram should make it useful right?

              <h1>Log 1: Destruction of property</h1>
             <p>here is the original product that i will be violating: </p>

                <p>i've already scalped its pcb, and am preparing to handwire it! just need to learn about qmk encoders yes...
                </p>



          <h1>Log 2: As if weather could stop me</h1>
          <p>painting! and as the title suggests, the temperatures are not sufficient for painting at all... but i did it nonetheless:  </p>

              <p>now i just need to get the encoders to work... except they don't work with a nano. no problem (though that does make the title quite incorect huh)! ill just use some potentiometers.
                they don't fit though, so i had to use some sneaky wire cutters:
              </p>  
              <img src="https://vibrant-hodgkin-c6365a.netlify.app/project/encoder/5.jpeg" width="225px">
              <img src="https://vibrant-hodgkin-c6365a.netlify.app/project/encoder/6.jpeg" width="400px">
              <p>now the encoders fit snugly! (well with a bit of magical glue)</p>
              <img src="https://vibrant-hodgkin-c6365a.netlify.app/project/encoder/7.jpeg" width="280px">
              <p>so now i just added mx blues (i know they arent great (i h*te clickys too) but they're the only fully black housing i have and its good to get them used finally)
                with some more super duper glue and now i just need to write it and program it properly!
              </p>

              <p>just waiting on some more potnetiometers to arrive, cya next time!</p>

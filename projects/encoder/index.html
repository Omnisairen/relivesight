            <h2>Encoder</h2>
            <p>—「0X://Explanation」<br>
          i had this midi device i never used, so a little bit of mx switches and microcontrollers that i know how to reprogram should make it useful right?
          {DISCLAIMER}: This project has nothing to do with encoders (anymore), just turns out im just dumb. i refuse to change the name. this project cost me $0.00 current dollars, but
          its pieces probably cost around $50. uses omriharel's <a type="_blank" href="https://github.com/omriharel/deej">deej</a>

              <h1>Log 1: Destruction of property</h1>
             <p>here is the original product that i will be violating: </p>
                <img src="https://vibrant-hodgkin-c6365a.netlify.app/project/encoder/1.jpg" width="500px">
                <p>i've already scalped its pcb, and am preparing to handwire it! just need to learn about the internals yes...
                </p>



          <h1>Log 2: As if weather could stop me</h1>
          <p>painting! and as the title suggests, the temperatures are not sufficient for painting at all... but i did it nonetheless:  </p>
              <img src="https://vibrant-hodgkin-c6365a.netlify.app/project/encoder/3.jpg" width="340px">
              <img src="https://vibrant-hodgkin-c6365a.netlify.app/project/encoder/4.jpg" width="298px">
              <p>now i just need to get the encoders to work... except they don't work with a nano. no problem (though that does make the title quite incorect huh)! ill just use some potentiometers.
                they don't fit though, so i had to use some sneaky wire cutters:
              </p>  
              <img src="https://vibrant-hodgkin-c6365a.netlify.app/project/encoder/5.jpg" width="225px">
              <img src="https://vibrant-hodgkin-c6365a.netlify.app/project/encoder/6.jpg" width="400px">
              <p>now the potentiometers fit snugly! (well with a bit of glue they will)</p>
              <img src="https://vibrant-hodgkin-c6365a.netlify.app/project/encoder/7.jpg" width="280px">
              <p>so now i just added mx blues (i know they arent great (i h*te clickys too) but they're the only fully black housing i have and its good to get them used finally)
                with some more super duper glue and now i just need to write it and program it properly!
              </p>

              <p>just gotta painfully hot glue these potentiommeters in and wire everythin up, cya next time!</p>

              <h1>Log 3: The Means of Production </h1>
              <p>so first things first, even though i said i was using glue, i hadn't actually dont it yet. i grabbed some liquid gel gorrilla glue and hot glue and got to work fitting the potentiometers in
              the encoder's previous home. worked pretty well, my genuis method of drying:</p>
                  <img src="https://vibrant-hodgkin-c6365a.netlify.app/project/encoder/11.jpg" width="320px">

                  <p>after they were dry, i glued them into the case and began the rudimentary wiring of them and the keyboard matrix:<p>  
                  <img src="https://vibrant-hodgkin-c6365a.netlify.app/project/encoder/12.jpg" width="500px">
                  <p>now to attach everything to the arduino nano, i find it easiest to solder to the nano's pins first:</p>
                  <img src="https://vibrant-hodgkin-c6365a.netlify.app/project/encoder/13.jpg" width="280px">
                  <p>and after an hour or so, its all soldered up! im pretty proud of how chaotic it is on the inside:
                  </p>
                  <img src="https://vibrant-hodgkin-c6365a.netlify.app/project/encoder/14.jpg" width="500px">
                  <p>while still being able to all close properly: </p>
                  <img src="https://vibrant-hodgkin-c6365a.netlify.app/project/encoder/15.jpg" width="500px">
                  <p>its all done! but i forgot to talk about the software that gets it to work, so lets do that. it's running 
                  omriharel's <a type="_blank" href="https://github.com/omriharel/deej">deej</a> which allows me to independantly adjust the volume of individual programs.
                  this will be extremely helpful to avoid touching the mouse to adjust spotify - youtube - game volume - master - mic input - etc on the fly, for example: while playing a game.
                  overall a great tool but theres still a bit more to touch on. but first, "glamour" shots: 
                  </p>
                  <img src="https://vibrant-hodgkin-c6365a.netlify.app/project/encoder/16.jpg" width="500px">
                  <img src="https://vibrant-hodgkin-c6365a.netlify.app/project/encoder/17.jpg" width="500px">
                  <img src="https://vibrant-hodgkin-c6365a.netlify.app/project/encoder/18.jpg" width="500px">
                  <p>excuse the bad shadows, i dont have room for a top light. now what's left? well i still need to improve the keyboard's functionality a bit.
                    ideas/thingsalreadyonit include:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>muting individual channels</li>
                    <li>muting mic/output devices</li>
                    <li>spotify controls</li>
                     </ul>
                     <p>other than that, thats it! thanks for reading~</p>

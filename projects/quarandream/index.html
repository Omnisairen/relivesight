    <h2>Quarandream</h2>
    <p>—「0X://Explanation」<br>
    Quite a lovely and useful project to me - its my daily driver
    </p>

      <h1>Beginnings</h1>
      <p>so i've always wanted a fully 3d-printed handwired build to main, but all these projects seemed too daunting and didnt have my favorite types of layouts.
        i finally got linked to:  <a href="http://dactyl.siskam.link/" target="_blank">this dactyl case generator</a>. so now that i could make the layout ive always wanted
      (and as a fun bonus its also easier to hand wire cuz of how tall it is) i could finally give it a try. this is my first large handwire and i was nervous i would completely mess it up
    but here is a quick guide of the process i went through. it was also nice to be able to build something without making any purchases!~</p>


    
      <h1>Hardware</h1>
      <!--

      <img src="../../images/projects/numpad/3.jpg" width="70%">  -->
      <p>things you will need:<br>
    > arduino pro micro<br>
      > key switches (c3 tangerines) <br>
      > [optional] lube (krytox g502)<br>
      > 3d printer (creality cr-10s <br>
      > printer filament (gray)<br>
       > dsa keycaps <br>
       > solder <br>
     > soldering iron <br>
       > wire <br>
       > diodes <br>
      > two wrist rests </p>


      <h1>Process</h1>
      <p>first up is creating the layout and hex file to flash the board, i have made a guide as to not repeat myself every handwire project: </p>
      <p><a href="/reference/firmware" target="_blank"> > keyboard layout creator < </a></p>
      <p>i think it is always best to start by flashing the pro micro first,
      so thats what i did. follow this guide i have made previously:</p>
      <p><a href="/reference/flashing" target="_blank"> > flashing arduino pro micro < </a></p>
      <p>next your gunna need a 3d model. i used this wonderful generator: </p>
      <p><a href="http://dactyl.siskam.link/" target="_blank"> > dactyl generator < </a></p>
      <p>also here is my unfinished handwiring guide just in case. but please follow something better if ur actually following along</p>
        <p><a href="/reference/handwire" target="_blank"> > handwiring < </a></p>
      <p><img src="../../images/projects/quarandream/6.jpeg" width="400px"></p>
      
      <p>now to the 'easy' stuff, i placed the keycaps in the slots, facing the correct ways and whatnot</p>
      <p><img src="../../images/projects/quarandream/9.jpeg" width="400px"></p>
      <p>and soldered the diodes, following the layout i generated earlier.</p>
      <p><img src="../../images/projects/quarandream/5.jpeg" width="400px"></p>
      <p>
      then i soldered the wires in place,</p>
      <p><img src="../../images/projects/quarandream/12d.jpeg" width="400px"></p>
      <p>then i soldered the wires directly to the arduino,</p>
      <p><img src="../../images/projects/quarandream/7.jpeg" width="400px"></p>
      <p>and finally i soldered the arduino to the matrix. i actually messed up a few times lol but it works.</p>
      <p>this actually worked first try! on both sides. i was very hapy with how it turned out. i didnt do any treatment to the 3d printe
        but i plan to do that to a future one sometime. total build time was across two days. heres some quick shots of it. wooo!!~

      <p>bonus: my layers</p>

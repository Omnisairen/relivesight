            <h2>Deej x2</h2>
            <p>—「0X://Explanation」<br>
          omriharel's <a type="_blank" href="https://github.com/omriharel/deej">deej</a> library is back again, this time with a new case found:
          <a type="_blank" href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4558424">here</a>! i had enough leftovers so i thought, why not make another <strike>(this may the beginning of an accidental deej 3 or 4)</strike>
          make that accidental x2, i ended up making two at the same time.

              <h1>Log 1: Size matters~</h1>
             <p>a quick minute on the printer and gathering parts resulted in this: </p>

                <p>i would start soldering now, but i want to make sure the screws fit before i start anything, the rest of the case will take overnight to print, so cya tomorrow or in a couple days!~</p>

                <h1>Log 2: Double the Trouble</h1>
                <p>well i had the time and materials so i decided to print two cases, so now i'm making two! but back to the task at hand, i tested out the screws and they fit. i grabbed my hot glue gun and
                  prepared to glue the encoders into place when i took a second to ponder the nuts that came with these encoders. after hitting myself in the face i put away the gluestick and (queue laughter):

                   <p>genuis i know. well with that handled the assembly of one of these is pretty simple. just attach the rows for 5v and gnd:</p>

                   <p>, solder pins onto the nanos, then wires to those pins:</p>

                <p> and finally attach everything together:</p>

                <p>now repeat and you have two of them, simple as that! not much of a learning process as i just made one of these a little while ago.

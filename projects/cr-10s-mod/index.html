            <p>—「0X://Explanation」<br>
             i wasnt using my printer enough cuz i was having trouble with the fans~ so instead of putting off my problems forever,
             i decided to learn more about my printer's construction and make an all in one! it honestly was quite intimidating!

              <h1>Log 1: Let's do it!</h1>
             <p>well first lets get a look at the appalling state of my printer:
             </p>
             <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Omnisairen/relivepics/main/projects/cr-10s-mod/1.jpg"style="width: 500px;"/>
             <p>yikes, i see why you wanna fix that, nice stickers tho! thanks me, now first of all i printed a better filament
                holder (which you can see is already on cuz i forgot to take the picture earlier):
            </p>
            <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Omnisairen/relivepics/main/projects/cr-10s-mod/2.jpg"style="width: 500px;"/>
          <p> then i printed all the pieces i needed for the upgrade, found <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3513661" target="_blank">here</a>, and 
          an alternate <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4316629" target="_blank">control box</a>, though i wouldnt recommend this since it doesnt fit the
        stock cr-10s board (but i managed to make it fit with some long screws):</p>
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Omnisairen/relivepics/main/projects/cr-10s-mod/3.jpg"style="width: 500px;"/>
         <p>also if you are following along you don't need to print the bottom right prints if ur not doing the rail mod (which i am not, idk why i printed them).
           besides a bit of difficulty taking off some supports, the printing actually went great! some cr-10s' have an alternate screen which a remixed model for the case 
           can be found <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4325299" target="_blank">here</a>, but i did not use this (even though i needed it). i just made it work
           with a little bit of tools~
         </p>  
         <p>
           next i ordered the pieces i needed... though the requirements said tnuts which i ordered, apparently they meant "t-slot hammerhead nuts". thanks guide that was very 
           clear (tnuts pictured left are not needed):
        </p>
         <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Omnisairen/relivepics/main/projects/cr-10s-mod/4.jpg"style="width: 500px;"/>
         <p>well while i wait for the correct nuts to arrive, i can at least see how far i can get without them. so
          next was the actually disassembly, which seemed really scary (i was and am still worried i am going to permanently break my printer), but here is what the inside looks like:
        </p>
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Omnisairen/relivepics/main/projects/cr-10s-mod/5.jpg"style="width: 500px;"/>

        <p>contrary to my hopes, there is no guide whatsoever on assembly (or disassembly for that matter), so i basically just winged it!
          here is a progress photo real quick:
        </p>
             
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Omnisairen/relivepics/main/projects/cr-10s-mod/6.jpg"style="width: 500px;"/>

        <p>scary!! will i be able to do it?</p>

        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Omnisairen/relivepics/main/projects/cr-10s-mod/7.jpg"style="width: 500px;"/>

        <p>so far? yes. this is as much progress i was able to make without the needed tnuts (which im still not sure exactly how they work)
          but they will be here tomorrow so thats all for now! i havent broken anything yet (that i know of) so im still hopeful~
        </p>


        <h1>Log 2: I did (not) do it!</h1>
        <p>i got the hammerhead nuts in the mail and assembled it all together:
        </p>
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Omnisairen/relivepics/main/projects/cr-10s-mod/8.jpg"style="width: 500px;"/>
        <p>a little ugly but it will do, the final product looks like this: 
       </p>
       <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Omnisairen/relivepics/main/projects/cr-10s-mod/9.jpg"style="width: 500px;"/>
        <p>i put it back in my closet and just look at all the free space i now have unlocked: </p>
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Omnisairen/relivepics/main/projects/cr-10s-mod/10.jpg"style="width: 500px;"/>
        <p>sadly this is where the good news ends, i attempted 2 tests prints even after trying multiple things to fix the new problem but
          the filament sensor (i think) is still causing errors, so ill try more things later but for now, the printer is out of commission (scary!). i really hope i 
          can fix it.,,

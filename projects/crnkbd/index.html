    <p>—「0X://Explanation」<br>
    a cheap hot swap thirty-some key diy board, this one is pretty and portable, plan on making two of em (yes i know its the crkbd but i spelled it wrong and im sticking with it)

      <h1>Log 1: Smd Diodes???</h1>
      <p>i had sat down with all my materials all ready to build it, then i realized there weren't spots for normal diodes, i then ordered some smd diodes and they are now on their way.
        naked keeb:

      <p>this one is hotswap, which is new for me to solder, though i dont think i will struggle, i just need some free time to build it</p>
      
      <h1>Log 2: Finished? If only.</h1>
      <p>i have acquired the so desired smd diodes, and they are about 10 times smaller than i expected:</p>

      <p>but its finally time to begin building! after looking up a strategy for the smd diodes (padding some solder on each place an smd diode will be set first) i set off to work, and lo and behold:
        the diodes and hotswap sockets went on without (much) of a hitch!

      <p>all that was left was the pro micro, reset switch, and trrs jacks. im always fearful installing a pro micro, but it looks like it went fine... firmware flashed and time for testing!
        i put on some switches and to my suprise.. nothing worked.

      <p>awhile later and turns out im just a dummy dumb. we are going to pretend i didnt program the layers on layer 1 and nothing on layer 0 -okay-.
        anyway with that figured out i tested the keys again and everything works! ...except 'q' 'a' and 'z', so one row is not working. i posted asking for some help and thats where im leaving it for now.
        ill get back to it when i can but im happy with what it looks like at least!

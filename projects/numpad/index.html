    <h2>Handwired Numpad</h2>
    <p>—「0X://Explanation」<br>
    My first true handwire - a log

      <h1>Beginnings</h1>
      <p>i've been building keyboards for months and months at this point (hopefully i have done write ups ex post facto) and i wanted
      to fully handwire, 3d print, and program my own keyboards. i had been reading up on what to do and buying tools to achieve this goal
      but instead pursued frivelous 'projects' and dallied about. i eventually got tired of this and on one of my days off of work, decided
      after school, i would 3d print, handwire, and program a keypad in a single day. this is the knowledge, hardware, and process that went into that.
      documenting this is hopefully interesting or helpful to you if you want to follow along yourself. </p>

      <h1>Hardware</h1>

      <p><a href="" target="_blank"> > wire < </a></p>
      <p><a href="" target="_blank"> > diodes < </a></p>


      <h1>Process</h1>
      <p>first up is creating the layout and hex file to flash the board, i have made a guide as to not repeat myself every handwire project: </p>
      <p><a href="/projects/uc" target="_blank"> > keyboard layout creator < </a></p>
      <p>i think it is always best to start by programming the pro micro first (as i have made some massive mistakes regarding the issue of not adhering to this)
      so thats what i did. follow this guide i have made previously:</p>
      <p><a href="/projects/uc" target="_blank"> > programming arduino pro micro < </a></p>
      <p>next your gunna need a 3d model. i acquired a 3d model from here, but making your own is very possible: </p>
      <p><a href="https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/gadget/mechanical-keyboard-sick-pad" target="_blank"> > sick-pad < </a></p>
      <p><img src="../../images/projects/numpad/4.jpg" width="400px"></p>
      <p>now to the easy stuff, i placed the keycaps in the slots, facing the correct way</p>
      <p><img src="../../images/projects/numpad/5.jpg" width="400px"></p>
      <p>and soldered the diodes, following the layout i generated earlier (to ensure precision).</p>
      <p><img src="../../images/projects/numpad/3.jpg" width="400px"></p>
      <p>
      then i soldered the wires in place,</p>
      <p><img src="../../images/projects/numpad/2.jpg" width="400px"></p>
      <p>and finally i soldered the wires directly to the arduino.</p>
      <p>since this project did not have an essential position for the arduino's port i didnt have to worry about that. i added keycaps and tested
      it to make sure everything worked. this project was completed in a hurry after a day off a school and albeit ugly it was a success.</p>

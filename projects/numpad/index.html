                <h1>Beginnings</h1><br>
                <p>i've been building keyboards for months and months at this point (hopefully i have done write ups ex post facto) and i wanted
                to fully handwire, 3d print, and program my own keyboards. i had been reading up on what to do and buying tools to achieve this goal
                but instead pursued frivelous 'projects' and dallied about. i eventually got tired of this and on one of my days off of work, decided
                after school, i would 3d print, handwire, and program a keypad in a single day. this is the knowledge, hardware, and process that went into that.
                documenting this is hopefully interesting or helpful to you if you want to follow along yourself.</p>

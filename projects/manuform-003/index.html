            <h2>Manuform-003</h2>
            <p>—「0X://Explanation」<br>
            the dactyl manuform generated from <a target="_blank" href="http://dactyl.siskam.link/">dactyl.siskam.link/</a> without a wrist rest.
            an attempt to do a split more properly, we'll see how it goes. (x2)

              <h1>Log 1: A Summary </h1>
             <p>i also started this before i set up the new ongoing system and didnt track this project much at all, but ill
               try to cover the process as best as possible.
             </p>
             <p>rapid fire! beginnings: i 3d printed the custom case i generated from <a target="_blank" href="http://dactyl.siskam.link/">dactyl.siskam.link/</a>,
            i lubed a bunch of switches, took two arduino pro micros and wired it up, programmed it and flashed it. wow that covers it that didnt take too long, some pictures:</p>

            <p>i also added keycaps and the final firmware, but now for the problems:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>its not wired as a split but as two keyboards</li>
                <li>the reset key doesn't work</li>
                <li>the bottom cant be screwed on</li>
                <li>the ports isnt a snug fit</li>
              </ul>
           <p> and those are the problems that persist to this day, next log should be mitaging those problems, but the board works for me for now, however unlike manuform-002 this one has
             a slot for an rj9 cable, which is already (mostly) wired, so the only real problem is figuring out the split wiring.

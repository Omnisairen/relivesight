            <h2>Merged Dactyl</h2>
            <p>—「0X://Explanation」<br>
              the merging of two dactyls into one for portability and ease of wiring sake, also hope it looks cool.

              <h1>Log 1: Professional Modelling</h1>
             <p>modelling is the brunt of this project, so until its done catch progress over at: the
              <a href="https://relivesight.com/projects/3dmodel">3d modelling learning page</a>, in the meantime, we can check out the
              settings i used for the dactyl generator found  <a target="_blank" href=" https://dactyl.siskam.link/">here</a>:
             </p>

             <h1>Log 2: Anddddd, We're Back!</h1>
             <p>assuming you definitely read the progess i made on the  <a href="https://relivesight.com/projects/3dmodel">3d modelling learning page</a>
            we are redoing all the work that happened there, but this time with manifold geometry. so first things first, i gotta figure out how to make the generated dactyl's manifold.
          after some testing, it looks like after each half is generated they are able to be printed, but importing them into blender shows they are full of non-manifold issues,
        and using "clean up" does not work... not entirely sure how to proceed.</p>
            <img src="https://vibrant-hodgkin-c6365a.netlify.app/project/mergeddactyl/3.png" width="500px">
            <p>okay i imported them into fusion, and it turns out if i don't intersect into them weirdly they will stay as
              regular bodies. example: i can intersect in to solid portions:
            </p>
            <img src="https://vibrant-hodgkin-c6365a.netlify.app/project/mergeddactyl/4.png" width="500px">
            <p>but not into broken geometry: </p>
            <img src="https://vibrant-hodgkin-c6365a.netlify.app/project/mergeddactyl/5.png" width="500px">
            <p>so im going to design a bride between them, and alter specific points as i receive errors, here is the bridge:</p>
            <img src="https://vibrant-hodgkin-c6365a.netlify.app/project/mergeddactyl/6.0.png" width="500px">
            <p>but if i try to connect it all at once i get an error: </p>
            <img src="https://vibrant-hodgkin-c6365a.netlify.app/project/mergeddactyl/7.png" width="500px">
            <p>so instead i piece by piece added the bridge, shortening individual parts to not intersect with non-manifold geometry, and it worked!
              they are all one solid body:
            </p>
            <img src="https://vibrant-hodgkin-c6365a.netlify.app/project/mergeddactyl/9.png" width="500px">
            <p>now just extruded the bottom for the plate and filled it in:</p>
            <img src="https://vibrant-hodgkin-c6365a.netlify.app/project/mergeddactyl/10.png" width="500px">
            <img src="https://vibrant-hodgkin-c6365a.netlify.app/project/mergeddactyl/11.png" width="500px">
            <p>now i am getting excitingly close to being done, but before i add details, i am going to do a test print for tolerances and thickness:</p>
            <img src="https://vibrant-hodgkin-c6365a.netlify.app/project/mergeddactyl/12.png" width="500px">
            <p>while that test prints, i added the teensy port: </p>
            <img src="https://vibrant-hodgkin-c6365a.netlify.app/project/mergeddactyl/13.png" width="500px">
            <p>test print complete, the threaded insert fits into 4mm holes as i estimated and a 4mm width on the cylindrical ring offers the best stability.
              though my estimates were exactly right, it is always good to test print!</p>
            <img src="https://vibrant-hodgkin-c6365a.netlify.app/project/mergeddactyl/1.jpeg" width="500px">

            <p>now i can add the holes to the case and to the plate: </p>
            <img src="https://vibrant-hodgkin-c6365a.netlify.app/project/mergeddactyl/15.png" width="500px">
            <img src="https://vibrant-hodgkin-c6365a.netlify.app/project/mergeddactyl/16.png" width="500px">

            <p>and that is it! woah that was fast, itll take a couple days to print both sides, so even if it goes error free,
              i won't be back here for 4 days, but don't fret, i will work on other projects in the meantime~ ill start by printing 
              the plate to make sure it fits on my printer (it's gunna be tight,,,)┈
            </p>
            <p>preview (it fits):</p>

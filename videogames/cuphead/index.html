                <h1>Summary</h1><br>
                <p>honestly a super amazing game, speedrunning it has caused me to develop a warped view of the game, i dislike certain bosses but only out of a sense of failing a run,
                  i still love their design/music/mechanics/etc. the main thing that i can't remember is when this game was hard, the feeling of beating the devil or the devil on expert, or the devil s rank are all lost to me,
                  now that i have beat it in 30ish min so many times, its hard to remember the times when i struggled. but i know the difficulty was initially a selling point for me, and i really enjoyed it for that, so much that i decided to take up speedrunning after all.

                </p>

                <h1>Design</h1><br>
                <p>has it been said a million times? what a lovely picturesque game, they perfectly captured what they were going for. look at some of the bosses:

                <br>
                <br>
                <h1>Speedrunning</h1><br>
                <p>so im a speedrunner of this game, a novice one at that, see pb at the time of writing  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJNy8CsgwAE&t=752s" target="_blank">> 30:28 <</a>
                and i just wanted to briefly talk about the way this game entices speedrunners like myself. after spending a bit of time grinding to get all the s ranks, you hit a pretty high level of skill,
              if you then discover legacy version and weapon swap glitch, skipping boss phases and dealing high damage is tons of funs, feels rewarding, and lets you get a pretty quick time when you just start. my first run
            was a time of around 53 minutes, which feels good from a former runner of super mario odyssey, in which my pb was 1:15. its also really enganging because messing up something small can cost minutes rather than in odyssey which mistakes only cost seconds,
          it makes it hard enough to stay interesting even for a talented player.</p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h1>Verdict</h1><br>
          <p>amazing out of ten</p>

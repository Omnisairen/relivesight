<br><h3>「Editing」┈</h3><p>so i spent about 1.5 hrs on an edit today, i mostly learned alot of things dont work haha. my software for encoding clips was broken (which makes editing slower)
  then i found out my rendering wasn't working, and i had to do all transitions manually, but i still rendered the edit i made in 480p (sad i know ;;) and posted it to: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ch4hhuk3Q&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">> youtube<</a> and
 <a href="https://www.instagram.com/omnisai.ren/?hl=en" target="_blank">> instagram <</a> either way i should be planning and preparing better methods so i can edit quicker and better, so wish me luck on that tomorrow! (or the next day)</p>
  
 <br><h3>「Keyboards」┈</h3><p>i lubed a whole bunch of switches while watching avatar! about a third of the way done with doing that,,,, lubing switches is sooo annoying</p>

                <h3>「Personal」┈</h3><p>been doing stuff, as will be elaborated below, i reorganized everything i have to do using trello, making completing things significantly more efficient and organized.
                  i even have a backburner for things im putting off. but mostly i had a bit of a motivational low recently, i am over it now! i am so so so so so excited to be making things again! i gotta be faster!
                </p>

<br><h3>「Website」┈</h3><p>i updated the: <a href="https://relivesight.com/spam/" target="_blank">> spam page <</a>, specifically the tech and pretty pages, which also offloaded my phone's storage quite a bit!
probably won't upload the spam page until i have 100 or so more photos.<br>
also i finally did this art page: <a href="https://relivesight.com/art/published" target="_blank">> published era<</a> its the art ive been working on! im pretty proud of it, but some of the textures do not look nice at large sizes so i should redo them rip,
ill probably just keep note of that for the future</p>

<br><h3>「Twitch」┈</h3><p>i started speedrunning cuphead on twitch at: <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/omnisairen" target="_blank">> omnisairen <</a>, im not too good at it, but its going alright so far,
ill be streaming tomorrow!</p>

                  stay hidden until it reaches presentable levels. yes code times
                </p>

<br><h3>「Website」┈</h3><p>i wrote some code,,,,,, it was really annoying exploring different ways to do this/get it done, it took way loinger than i planned it would, but i did a quick document about it and it will save me lots of time in the future:
  <a href="https://relivesight.com/code/ggldcs/" target="_blank">> ggldcs <</a> i had to learn highlight.js for this aaaak
<br>and using that i was able to create a place to spam images!!!!! introducing <a href="https://relivesight.com/spam/" target="_blank">> !spam! <</a> ive already got like 700 pictures up there over just three pages,
thats all pretty much!</p>

                <h3>「Personal」┈</h3><p>the big log is here!! i'm back, school is almost done but i'll have some time before summer hits to be more active again.
                  i have been up to alot and really have been expreiencing alot of different things lately~ the lake trip was probably the most exciting thing, or rather the biggest change of pace.
                i finished lots of schoolwork and such and was able to take a quick vacation with friends, i took lots of videos and pictures and i plan on making a little video project, but im very
              inspired to do other things right now so i can't guruantee that i will be able to, but heres a picture of an abandoned church i went in, and the lake:</p>

<h3>「Storage」┈</h3><p>this is most tangentially related to the process of writing this log, but least to the continuity of the post, so sorry, but effectively what is going on is
  the service i host on only allows 1gb for repositories, and you ain't catching me paying for premiums. but my storage is at 800ish megabytes rn, so i have to do something, my solution is genuis! i think...
  i am utilizing the 15gb google drive upload space to upload my images. and i use a little code trick to sneak them into my site hehehe. all the images from here on out will be hosted this way, apologies for potential
  slower load times, but i don't think it'll be particularly a problem. this log is the first post using this trick!~
</p><br>
<h3>「Stickers」┈</h3><p>i bought some sticker paper and printed some stickers! i don't know how clear societal movements have been on here but as the sovei(rr)n head of the re:Live society i thought i would print
  some stickers for our logo, designed by yours truly. this may be the time i've shown it, expect more to come. i put the stickers on the back of a keyboard and on my wireless earbud case as shown:
</p>

<br><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=11ztNXB1taLdNw4Izk4PXf9wYs0yE0qdQ" width="404px"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1evhTWNYdLV3F3nDcNRgatAOLBsTI41i4" width="404px"><br>
<p>also cutting those stickers was harder than it seemed, but my hands have gotten so much steadier since i picked up so many precise hobbies</p>

<br><h3>「Website」┈</h3><p>i got a project log done, its from quite an old project but here it is: 
  <a href="https://relivesight.com/projects/wiitea/" target="_blank">> wiitea project log <</a> this was a fun one to do and i plan on more sticker bombs in the future.
<br>did you think i only got one log done while i was busy? sike! <a href="https://relivesight.com/projects/smore/" target="_blank">> the smore log <</a> this keyboard was lots of fun to build but i probably
wont use it, also it wasnt fun at all i lied sorry, for some reason i have fond memories, but in actuality it was painful wiring the oled screens and micros especially cuz i made a mistake, but new keyboards coming soon</p>

<br><h3>「Keyboards」┈</h3><p>4 new builds in the works, the most laborious part of this is the switch lubing,,,, which speaking of i should write a log on</p>

<br><h3>「Speedrunning」┈</h3><p>i am taking time to get back into speedrunning, i enjoy it alot, though it takes lots of concentration, practice, and perfection, its oddly lethargic sometimes, or maybe thats in concept as i'm
  not running right now. hopefully this stream of conciousness without proofreading is alright, i think it better expresses my state of mind but then again who am i to know? oh what im me, sorry that wasnt funny. anyway heres my youtube
  channel that has my runs: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaw9NyNvudFpHxljwC_Xlmw/videos" target="_blank">> spdrunchannel <</a> i actually plan on renaming this channel Omnisai Runs and making a new channel so stick around for that,
  also check out my speedrun.com profile for my official ranked runs at: <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/user/omnisairen" target="_blank">> speedrun.com <</a> 
</p>

<br><h3>「Art」┈</h3><p>so for starters i did draw some digital art but i scrapped it, cuz it was bad, but i did one i kinda liked! check it out and the unshown prevy to now re:Live Society logo at:
  <a href="https://relivesight.com/art/graphic/" target="_blank">> graphic art page <</a> and i mean since i showed the logo i guess i should show the pins themselves.
  blurry pic of me with the pin on my belt: <br><br><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1cBWfJ35_3dq8AGcERz9ozAOnjU55OcH_" width="304px">
</p>

<br><h3>「Music Video」┈</h3><p>im working on some stuff for my brother's upcoming albulm, we shot a video of him in the grass to look like an albulm cover but its a video the length of the song,
  artsy i know~ but in all seriousness its pretty cool, we decided to go with the shot that was my fav (and my idea hehe) heres two edited images of what itll be, even though he rejected the b&w one, i like it, well i should get rid of that
  overexposure but its not being used anyway so oh well, oh yes the images here: <br><br><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=13p1s5_iriRe6XQBctF4h1qR5SsQTRpKI" width="404px"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=170awr80sJM9i6m4wB0QR_8ZePl2T8sGu" width="404px">
</p>

<br><h3>「Youtube」┈</h3><p>i listened to alot of interviews of matty healy from the 1975 and he is quite an intelligent and true to himself individual, i aspire to be that aware of my own emotions/actions/thoughts/etc.
  it truly is mind blowing to see someone so in touch with themselves and their music. quite the guy~ </p>

                  <a href="https://relivesight.com/videogames/hollowknight/" target="_blank">> hollow knight review <</a> i absolutely adore this game (just beat it 100%),
                  it is pheneomal and i highly recommend it, i also really want to play steelsoul mode and 100% it, but you have to beat the whole game,
                  without dying, at all................ THATS TOO HARD ;;;;; but i really want to beat it that wayyy aaaa. i practiced the Radiance a few times
                  and was able to do it without taking damage once, but it would be hard to consistently on top of every part of this game already, hopefully i can do it someday tho.<br>

                <h3>「Personal」┈</h3><p>last day in the first week of logs! doing pretty gud! i put a glass screen protector on my phone instead of the stock one finally.
                  i was really nervous i had permanantly damaged my screen cuz i didnt have too much faith in the factory screen protector, but it turned out when i removed it
                  my phone screen looked pristine! putting on the glass one also went very well, so im not so worried about taking a knife to my screen anymore~ also it was cloudy so i went on a bike ride! 
</p><br>
               <h3>「Website」┈</h3><p>lots of different places on the website today! please check them out!<br><br>
                <a href="https://relivesight.com/projects/2b/" target="_blank">> 2b <</a> is all painted now! she still needs a second coat of paint to completely cover up the imperfections but i was too impatient and had
              to post it imediately! i was nervous i mixed colors poorly for her thigh highs but they ended up looking really well! <br> 
              <br> <a href="https://relivesight.com/video/" target="_blank">> The video page <</a> is up! this will be the hub for anything with a video, and all youtube vids, etc should be embeded.
              <br> <br><a href="https://relivesight.com/video/mv/" target="_blank">> The music video area <</a> is started now! check out my first one i was working on like 9 months and never finished.
            there is like a 3 sec part that i duplicated a few times cuz i planned on changing more but its the best part, its the overedited 'kiss' part of the chorus, so yes you have to watch a long time. i used
            the rotoscoping techniques i know and lots of red giant suite lighting effects to make it look professional. i think the 'velocity-sync' for the video is alright, and there are some nice highly edited transitions
            but i dont think they fit the song very well, i mean it was only practice anyway! also sorry for the low quality on youtube, i had lots of file size problems! like i wasnt gunna talk about it but srsly what on earth let me explain,
            i rendered the vid at half the quality i made it: 37gb...... LIKE WHAT~! so then i ran it through handbrake to lower the quality and change it to an m4k file and... 68mb... im at a loss for words

            <br> <br><a href="https://relivesight.com/video/kshootmania/" target="_blank">> Kshootmania <</a> is a game i want to get good at i think! a long time ago i set it up to play but it didnt fit well with my setup,
          so i moved it to my secondary setup and i have wanted to play it lots more! ive logged quite a bit of hours in osu but that game is bad for my wrists (arthritis ;;) so i wanted to play a different kind of game,
        this seemed to be it! gave it a cool skin and its all working! someday ill write about the little adventure i had setting up my computer as a konami registered game cabinet.. heheh</p><br>
       
      <h3>「3d printing」┈</h3><p>a coat of primer and some more 240 grit sanding on an upcoming keeb, i also got half a keeb that i gotta figure out what to do with... hmmmm
     <br><br> <img src="../images/daily/42820/1.jpeg" width="406px">
      </p><br>
   
      <h3>「Music」┈</h3><p>i listened to lots of different stuff today, oh oh oh!!! i found out there were two songs in hamilton ost that i hadnt heard cuz i only listen to the obc and not a bootleg.
        they are soooo sad and emotional and aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa. here are some animatics of them:
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDio2AGtL7w" target="_blank">Laurens Interlude</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQh-7-PNgoU" target="_blank">Congratulations</a>
       why does a historical musical produce so many tears. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; "i have so much work to do" aah hamilton is such an inspirtation.
      also also i might as well quick mention everything i listened to today: artist names: nf, the royal they, bear ghost, jack conte, alicebanD, haru nemuri, hatsune miku, neru, forgive durden, art sorority, shayfer james, i the mighty, lemon demon, rare americans, like 5 musicals, and MOB CHOIR.</p><br>
   
         
      <h3>「Fact of the day」┈</h3><p>i finished this log 17 minutes late, which is actually pretty good compared to how i usually finish at like 1 or 2 am lolll.

                  i highly recommend watching the video. i also listened to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppGaFJ0CY64" target="_blank">this</a> on low volume to set the mood more for the video. i absolutely adore everything about this game and hope i can
                find a week or so to play the game hardcore. i think this is right up my alley, at the expense of scarying me to my core, but who said games are supposed to be fun.</p><br>

                 <h3>「Code」┈</h3><p>aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa big progress. so so so so so my initial plan was to train a chatbot ai using tensorflow and use large datasets. i want an ai with a personality though, and i cant do that unless the data sets are representative of a personality.
                   this is near impossible because tons of data (like at least 50k conversations) are needed to train these things well, and i couldnt feasibly generate such a long list myself. in all actuality i dont entirely want a chatbot that mimics human speech, but a character that can respond
                   to general inqueries (for a project im working on, codename: MaiTen *details coming soon). so i reevaulated my plan, and instead of an ai that can generate complex answers, what if i make one that can understand complex quetsions, but responds with a preset list of responses. this seemed equally difficult,
                   but if achieved would have a controllable personality by me. i will document the boring research process that went along with this, but after a significant amount of fiddling and frusturation (while listening to that lovely video on pathologic and the beautiful hollow knight ost) i finally got it to work!!!!!
                   <br>here is it knowing who it is:

                <p><img src="../images/daily/42620/1.png" width="800px"></p><br><p>ill be devoloping the personality, gui, art, etc later! but i got it off the ground and have the confidence i can finish it now</p><br>
                
                <h3>「Games」┈</h3><p>i made my second setup a sdvx and kshootmania hub! i hadnt played those games in awhile</p><br><p><img src="../images/daily/42620/1.jpeg" width="310px"></p>
                <h3>「Hardware」┈</h3><p>i am going to try to turn this array of computers into a functional server rack, so i added some monitors so i can quickly switch between computers.
                  also ive got windows 7, windows xp, lakka, linux, and windows 10 on these computers!

                <h3>「Website」┈</h3><p> today i wrote the whole handwire guide, i also updated the project logs to account for the newest project.
                  i made a post about it on reddit too but ehh i mostly just wanted to get that project over with. id be happy to welcome new readers because of it though!
                  i made this page... kind of obious tho, i did some backend cleanup and yeah, most stuff was finished on previous days, too bad im starting this so late.
                </p><br>
                <h3>「3d Prints」┈</h3><p> i finished my print of the alice handwire keyboard layout, and no im not gunna link to that this is my writing blog where i do what i want, check a project log if
                  you want me to be helpful baka. i found it from keebfol.io tho lol. anyone thats a bust since the microcontroller is not one i have, so lots of blue filament down the drain. in good news it was finally warm
                  enough to try painting a 3d print, i painted my upcoming dactyl, and two test figurines before i paint 2b and 9s (hollow knight and a luma from smg). i also started printing another dactyl in blue
                  so more painting attempts, sanding seems to be very key, i used primer after sanding but i should probably sand again after and then prime again, or try using filler, so ill see if i can do one of those soon.

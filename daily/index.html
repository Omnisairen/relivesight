                <h1>Day One</h1><br>
                <h3>Website</h3><p> today i wrote the whole handwire guide, i also updated the project logs to account for the newest project.
                  i made a post about it on reddit too but ehh i mostly just wanted to get that project over with. id be happy to welcome new readers because of it though!
                  i made this page... kind of obious tho, i did some backend cleanup and yeah, most stuff was finished on previous days, too bad im starting this so late.
                </p><br>
                <h3>3d Prints</h3><p> i finished my print of the alice handwire keyboard layout, and no im not gunna link to that this is my writing blog where i do what i want, check a project log if
                  you want me to be helpful baka. i found it from keebfol.io tho lol. anyone thats a bust since the microcontroller is not one i have, so lots of blue filament down the drain. in good news it was finally warm
                  enough to try painting a 3d print, i painted my upcoming dactyl, and two test figurines before i paint 2b and 9s (hollow knight and a luma from smg). i also started printing another dactyl in blue
                  so more painting attempts, sanding seems to be very key, i used primer after sanding but i should probably sand again after and then prime again, or try using filler, so ill see if i can do one of those soon.
  
                </p><br>
                <h3>Games</h3><p> i only had time to play a little burnout revenge, i need to get back to playing nier smhhhh

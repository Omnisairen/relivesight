                <h3>Personal</h3><p>back at logs!!! ive been up to alot!</p><br>
               


                <h3>Game</h3><p>i played about 25 hours of hollow knight over the last few days aaaa, so i wrote a brief review:
                  <a href="https://relivesight.com/videogames/hollowknight/" target="_blank">> hollow knight review <</a> i absolutely adore this game (just beat it 100%),
                  it is pheneomal and i highly recommend it, i also really want to play steelsoul mode and 100% it, but you have to beat the whole game,
                  without dying, at all................ THATS TOO HARD ;;;;; but i really want to beat it that wayyy aaaa. i practiced the Radiance a few times
                  and was able to do it without taking damage once, but it would be hard to consistently on top of every part of this game already, hopefully i can do it someday tho.<br> 
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Keyboard</h3><p>woops, forgot to write the blog for the s'more, i will soon, also i am 3d printing the pieces for my new keyboard project, that

                <h3>Personal</h3><p>last day in the first week of logs! doing pretty gud! i put a glass screen protector on my phone instead of the stock one finally.
                  i was really nervous i had permanantly damaged my screen cuz i didnt have too much faith in the factory screen protector, but it turned out when i removed it
                  my phone screen looked pristine! putting on the glass one also went very well, so im not so worried about taking a knife to my screen anymore~ also it was cloudy so i went on a bike ride! 
</p><br>
               <h3>Website</h3><p>lots of different places on the website today! please check them out!<br><br>
                <a href="https://relivesight.com/projects/2b/" target="_blank">> 2b <</a> is all painted now! she still needs a second coat of paint to completely cover up the imperfections but i was too impatient and had
              to post it imediately! i was nervous i mixed colors poorly for her thigh highs but they ended up looking really well! <br> 
              <br> <a href="https://relivesight.com/video/" target="_blank">> The video page <</a> is up! this will be the hub for anything with a video, and all youtube vids, etc should be embeded.
              <br> <br><a href="https://relivesight.com/video/mv/" target="_blank">> The music video area <</a> is started now! check out my first one i was working on like 9 months and never finished.
            there is like a 3 sec part that i duplicated a few times cuz i planned on changing more but its the best part, its the overedited 'kiss' part of the chorus, so yes you have to watch a long time. i used
            the rotoscoping techniques i know and lots of red giant suite lighting effects to make it look professional. i think the 'velocity-sync' for the video is alright, and there are some nice highly edited transitions
            but i dont think they fit the song very well, i mean it was only practice anyway! also sorry for the low quality on youtube, i had lots of file size problems! like i wasnt gunna talk about it but srsly what on earth let me explain,
            i rendered the vid at half the quality i made it: 37gb...... LIKE WHAT~! so then i ran it through handbrake to lower the quality and change it to an m4k file and... 68mb... im at a loss for words

            <br> <br><a href="https://relivesight.com/video/kshootmania/" target="_blank">> Kshootmania <</a> is a game i want to get good at i think! a long time ago i set it up to play but it didnt fit well with my setup,
          so i moved it to my secondary setup and i have wanted to play it lots more! ive logged quite a bit of hours in osu but that game is bad for my wrists (arthritis ;;) so i wanted to play a different kind of game,
        this seemed to be it! gave it a cool skin and its all working! someday ill write about the little adventure i had setting up my computer as a konami registered game cabinet.. heheh</p><br>
       
      <h3>3d printing</h3><p>a coat of primer and some more 240 grit sanding on an upcoming keeb, i also got half a keeb that i gotta figure out what to do with... hmmmm
     <br><br> <img src="../images/daily/42820/1.jpeg" width="406px">
      </p><br>
   
      <h3>Music</h3><p>i listened to lots of different stuff today, oh oh oh!!! i found out there were two songs in hamilton ost that i hadnt heard cuz i only listen to the obc and not a bootleg.
        they are soooo sad and emotional and aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa. here are some animatics of them:
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDio2AGtL7w" target="_blank">Laurens Interlude</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQh-7-PNgoU" target="_blank">Congratulations</a>
       why does a historical musical produce so many tears. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; "i have so much work to do" aah hamilton is such an inspirtation.
      also also i might as well quick mention everything i listened to today: artist names: nf, the royal they, bear ghost, jack conte, alicebanD, haru nemuri, hatsune miku, neru, forgive durden, art sorority, shayfer james, i the mighty, lemon demon, rare americans, like 5 musicals, and MOB CHOIR.</p><br>
   
         
      <h3>Fact of the day</h3><p>i finished this log 17 minutes late, which is actually pretty good compared to how i usually finish at like 1 or 2 am lolll.

                <h3>Personal</h3><p>i listened to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsNm2YLrk30" target="_blank">130 min video</a> about the game pathologic and i am absolutely dying to play this game or pathologic 2, which is even better so ive heard.
                  i highly recommend watching the video. i also listened to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppGaFJ0CY64" target="_blank">this</a> on low volume to set the mood more for the video. i absolutely adore everything about this game and hope i can
                find a week or so to play the game hardcore. i think this is right up my alley, at the expense of scarying me to my core, but who said games are supposed to be fun.</p><br>
                <p><img src="../images/daily/42620/1.jpg" width="406px"><img src="../images/daily/42620/2.jpg" width="406px"><img src="../images/daily/42620/3.jpg" width="812px"></p><br><p>also happy birthday sam!</p><br>
                
            
                 <h3>Code</h3><p>aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa big progress. so so so so so my initial plan was to train a chatbot ai using tensorflow and use large datasets. i want an ai with a personality though, and i cant do that unless the data sets are representative of a personality.
                   this is near impossible because tons of data (like at least 50k conversations) are needed to train these things well, and i couldnt feasibly generate such a long list myself. in all actuality i dont entirely want a chatbot that mimics human speech, but a character that can respond
                   to general inqueries (for a project im working on, codename: MaiTen *details coming soon). so i reevaulated my plan, and instead of an ai that can generate complex answers, what if i make one that can understand complex quetsions, but responds with a preset list of responses. this seemed equally difficult,
                   but if achieved would have a controllable personality by me. i will document the boring research process that went along with this, but after a significant amount of fiddling and frusturation (while listening to that lovely video on pathologic and the beautiful hollow knight ost) i finally got it to work!!!!!
                   <br>here is it knowing who it is:
                 </p><br>
                <p><img src="../images/daily/42620/1.png" width="800px"></p><br><p>ill be devoloping the personality, gui, art, etc later! but i got it off the ground and have the confidence i can finish it now</p><br>
                
                <h3>Games</h3><p>i made my second setup a sdvx and kshootmania hub! i hadnt played those games in awhile</p><br><p><img src="../images/daily/42620/1.jpeg" width="310px"></p>
                <h3>Hardware</h3><p>i am going to try to turn this array of computers into a functional server rack, so i added some monitors so i can quickly switch between computers.
                  also ive got windows 7, windows xp, lakka, linux, and windows 10 on these computers!
                </p><br><p><img src="../images/daily/42620/2.jpeg" width="810px"></p>
                
                <br><h3>Fact of the day</h3><p>to play this game follow the directions and stop moving when you hear freeze. if you are touching the lucky pad, you win.

                <h1>Day One</h1><br>
                <h3>Website</h3><p> today i wrote the whole handwire guide, i also updated the project logs to account for the newest project.
                  i made a post about it on reddit too but ehh i mostly just wanted to get that project over with. id be happy to welcome new readers because of it though!
                  i made this page... kind of obious tho, i did some backend cleanup and yeah, most stuff was finished on previous days, too bad im starting this so late.
                </p><br>
                <h3>3d Prints</h3><p> i finished my print of the alice handwire keyboard layout, and no im not gunna link to that this is my writing blog where i do what i want, check a project log if
                  you want me to be helpful baka. i found it from keebfol.io tho lol. anyone thats a bust since the microcontroller is not one i have, so lots of blue filament down the drain. in good news it was finally warm
                  enough to try painting a 3d print, i painted my upcoming dactyl, and two test figurines before i paint 2b and 9s (hollow knight and a luma from smg). i also started printing another dactyl in blue
                  so more painting attempts, sanding seems to be very key, i used primer after sanding but i should probably sand again after and then prime again, or try using filler, so ill see if i can do one of those soon.

    More is done. im trying to get more and more of the backlogs done as i go (shown in the image section below :: known as 「0X://Breathing」for you uninitiated)
  
      Which ill address that yes i know the guest book is kinda broken and it will only show 10 comments, yes ill fix it eventually, but for now im trying to make this site a more interesting place to stumble across, with lots of resources and produced things
      other than just< a bio about myself. the first of many steps in that direction is the <a target="_blank" href="https://relivesight.com/sites/">sites page</a>. and quite contridictory to this anti-narcisistic change is the
      <a target="_blank" href="https://relivesight.com/about/">about page</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://relivesight.com/art/irl/">irl pics sub-art page</a> which feature pics of me that im semi proud of. im trying to find a
      style, and ill take some time to learn in photoshop when i can~

    Finished legend of korra - not even sure if i can offer an unbiased stand point on it. 《in english so i can code/etc while watching it? 
   good corieography? good worldbuilding / character devlopment? talented voice actors?》 yup you win! i literally cant do anything other than appreciate this. nonetheless i truly think it is worth critical 'acclaim'
   and i will personally discuss and disprove any issues you have with it​♡ 
   <br>
 </p>

<p>—「03://WebVentures」<br>
  I can pretend i was enlightened earlier / but alas i would be deceiving, i have finally mastered irc and tis a great method of communication. special private discussion can happen there,,,
  i recently discovered
  a particular magazine which has inspired me to potentially develop something like this of my own. hopefully im not too out of place here.
  it will truly take some intense photoshop practice first, as their covers especially are a sight to behold. four is a/a/a/a//a/a/a/ personal favorite of mine.

    indeed, i very clearly updated this page┈♡~ hopefully the changes are viewed as upgrades, cuz thats how
    i see them,! the code was a bit intricate to make this work┈ its also like my second time using animations. also the full outline wasnt working initially, cuz i forgot the page id had overlap:hidden; how cringe of me ✿ but in the end it all worked out!!!~ and im not applying the new effects to the old logs to show the distinctions but then and ███████.

<p>—「02://Manga/Shows」<br>
  the legend of korra really knows how to hold one's attention,,,,its utilizing the
  intruige of its natural world building to force me to excuse a flashback sequence, truly the cruelest move they could perform against someone trying to think critically about the show. it frequently jogs my memory about the parts i loved about the last airbender, and does a fantastic job of cleaning up its flaws, tho its definitely far from free of them itself. also i dont mean to fangirl but varrick being a villain is so gooooood but also aaaaaAAAAaaa sdlksdjsjdjjjddddd i LOVE HIm his character is SO sporatic teach me to be that eccentric~

    <h1>2019-08-07</h1>
    <p>Copy-editing has begun for lainzine 6, but we are still accepting submissions for the release until Tuesday (at the earliest). If you'd like to help out, we're using <a href="https://keybase.io/team/lainzine">Keybase</a> to discuss new submissions and peer-review.</p>
    <p>Last night, the mailing list was first updated as well.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You're Hashing It Wrong</li>
      <li>I Am Your Virtual Host</li>
      <li>Extracting Visual Novel Resources</li>
      <li>How To Collect Garbage</li>
      <li>Mass Surveillance in Russia</li>
      <li>Lean and Mean: Devuan Linux Setup</li>

      <li>PHYSICAL SECURITY, or how to save your ass (and soothe your paranoia) after screwing up on the wired</li>
      <li>potential VPN attacks</li>
    </ul>
   <p>Submissions for future releases are now open. You can submit articles <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#x6C;&#116;&#x6F;:&#108;&#97;&#105;&#x6E;z&#105;&#110;&#x65;&#64;&#112;&#114;&#111;&#x74;&#111;&#x6E;m&#97;&#105;&#x6C;&#46;&#x63;&#111;&#x6D;">to our email</a>. We will be moving from a volume-based release cycle to a continuous release schedule, where articles will be released at the same frequency they are submitted, as webpages on the site. Every 5-10 articles, we will curate a zine of articles and release a PDF, as well as sell a physical copy. This is to keep the lainzine on a regular release schedule, and prevent bottlenecks caused by all of our content being in huge PDFs, while also keeping in mind the preferences of readers who liked the PDFs. Once lainzine 6 is released, expect to see a big PDF of lainzine 5 content, and potentially an anthology of lainzines 4, 5, and 6 as well.</p>

    <p>Auntie's <a href="all-releases/lainzine05/java.pdf">first full typeset</a> has been uploaded!🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 <br/>Along with some really nice looking cover pages for several LZ5 pieces, courtesy of President Reagan.</p>
    <p>Additionally, we're hosting <a href="HFTW.pdf">Hello From The Wired</a> for posterity. We are currently up to 8 text releases for lainzine 6, and are waiting on 2 more to come in, but we haven't run out of room yet! we can definitely accept 1-2 more pieces for this release, and you are always welcome to submit for inclusion in future releases. In the meanwhile, check out our new friends at <a href="surfaces.html">surfaces</a> magazine, a prose-and-poetry publication that seems to like us, and also <a href="https://cyberspaceantifa.noblogs.org/">another site</a> with some very important content up this month.</p>
    
    <p>Finally, the newsletter mailing list has been created. I will be adding everyone who emailed me about it shortly, but you can also just <a href="https://lists.riseup.net/www/subscribe/lainzine">subscribe</a>.</p>

    <h1>2019-01-07</h1>
    
    <p>Please welcome Auntie, the newest member of our team! He will be supporting President Reagan in the typesetting and page layout.</p>
    <p>More updates: From the survey results you are still sending in (:o), we've decided to create a mailing list! email <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#x6C;&#116;&#x6F;:&#108;&#97;&#105;&#x6E;z&#105;&#110;&#x65;&#64;&#112;&#114;&#111;&#x74;&#111;&#x6E;m&#97;&#105;&#x6C;&#46;&#x63;&#111;&#x6D;">&#108;&#97;&#105;&#x6E;z&#105;&#110;&#x65;&#64;&#112;&#114;&#111;&#x74;&#111;&#x6E;m&#97;&#105;&#x6C;&#46;&#x63;&#111;&#x6D;</a> to be added, and we will try to get everyone who already contacted us about it, too. We are thinking about RSS and a Matrix bridge for our current IRC room (#lainzine on freenode) as well, the current issue is that we don't have a dedicated server for these things - neocities does not provide any sort of server-side programming that would make an RSS feed easy to update and not involve typing in XML stuff by hand.</p>
    <p>We are still working on lainzine 5, and expect to release a PDF in February. Thank you so much for being patient, and in the meanwhile, be sure to check out Auntie's typeset of Nyx Land's <a href="https://my.mixtape.moe/dnvasq.pdf">Cyber-Nihilist Manifesto</a>. "The typesetting kind of surpasses the text itself lmao" - Nyx Land, twitter.</p>
    <p>Also be sure to check out <a href="https://blackfogzine.org/">Black Fog Zine</a>, a newly-released last year weird art online magazine that started the same place we did.</p>
    <p>Moving forward is trying to print physical releases: we've reached out to find local printers in Europe (Corsica), but thru survey results we are also interested in printing services in Australia, the United States, and Brazil, among others. We are looking for local services to have as little overhead as possible, so those interested in buying copies can pay as little as possible. We are also thinking about making merchandise in-house, such as clothes and stickers. Stay tuned for details!</p>
    <p>Finally, lainzine 6 currently has 5 article submissions and 16 pieces of original artwork (submitted by 2 artists) so far, as well as 1-3 additional works we may include depending on how much more content is sent. Submissions are absolutely still open, so if you have anything you want to submit, or for us to review, or even to start writing something, now would be a perfect time to do that. Thank you again for enjoying our work all these years.</p>

    <p>Polling encouraged us to bold the titles of every article on <a href="all-releases/lainzine05/index.html">volume 5</a> that was finished in the PDF. We are still polling, and would really like it if people took the <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/X5NP3RT">9-question survey about our content</a>. Other results so far have been that you all like the technical howtos but would like to see more art and "abstract," philosophical sort of content and commentary. We are looking into the problem somebody is having with qutebrowser, and @ the lain who asked for my phone number it is [redacted]. </p>
    <p>Liberapay has finally fixed their team donation feature, meaning that you no longer have to donate to individual team members and can <a href="https://liberapay.com/lainzine">instead donate to the whole project's collective fund</a>. Thank you all for the support so far!</p>

<p>—「01://Website」<br>
  World Of Warcraft did days go by!, i started this post 8 days ago, but here we are today. Either way i felt like i had to do something for the site today,
  so i wrote a <a href="https://relivesight.com/reference/ds3mod/" target="_blank">tutorial for randomizing ds3</a> since that was something i did over my blog absence. Its
  absolutely joyfully horrendous and i highly recommend if you have completeled Dark Souls 3. 
  I also added my twitch to my <a href="https://relivesight.com/bio/" target="_blank">bio</a>.
  I will return to working on the website, predominantly the parts that don't involve me, since i want to expand this from a personal blog to a more functional site for others.
  Though i can't gurauntee the rate at which progress proceeds, considering i start college relatively soon. However, i will try my best!~

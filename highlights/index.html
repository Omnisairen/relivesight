    <p>—「02://Points of Interest」<br>
       this site is a passion project of mine, it is a bit of a aesthetic expression but also a hopefully functional site for following along with my projects so that
       maybe you are able to learn something yourself! there's quite a bit here, and some parts of the site get neglected more than others (there is alot to keep up on) so heres some highlights if you want to see which
       projects and pages i am the most proud of:
      </p>

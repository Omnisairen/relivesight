        <h1>Top 10 Anime Descriptions</h1>
        <p>—「01://Who am I?」<br>
      i am ren rose, i have quite a few hobbies and if you wanna read more about me reference my <strike>cringe</strike> <a href="https://relivesight.com/bio">bio</a>.
    but i could sum it all up by saying i am a 'technology enthusiast' since none of my hobbies would be possible without tech (but please dont apply such a limiting description to me).</p>
        
    
    <p>—「02://Points of Interest」<br>
       this site is a passion project of mine, it is a bit of a aesthetic expression but also a hopefully functional site for following along with my projects so that
       maybe you learn something yourself! there's quite a bit here, and some parts of the site get neglected more than others (there is alot to keep up on) so heres some highlights if you want to see which
       projects and pages i am the most proud of:
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li><a href="https://relivesight.com/projects/433/">433% keyboard</a> - possibly the largest keyboard built by one person</li>
          <li><a href="https://relivesight.com/projects/mikuyboard/">mikuyboard</a> - a 128 keyboard covered in hastune miku stickers</li>
          <li><a href="https://relivesight.com/projects/quarandream/">quarandream</a> - my favorite split keyboard ive made</li>
          <li><a href="https://relivesight.com/projects/video/">video</a> - a hub for all video projects ive done (not too many atm)</li>
          <li><a href="https://relivesight.com/projects/manga/">manga</a> - a hub for the one scanlation i've done</li>
          <li><a href="https://relivesight.com/concept/book/">book</a> - 1 million 'words' honestly just so i can say im a published author</li>
